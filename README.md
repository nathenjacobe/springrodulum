# springrodulum
## simulation of a springdulum attached to a mass attached to a rod attached to another mass
### (also includes a simulation of a double pendulum)

solved using euler-lagrange then computed accelerations of r, theta and phi using a matrix, which was then used to form an iterative formula using RK4 instead of euler integration.
